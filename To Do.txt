Challenges:
-create a challenge vs another user
-submit
-accept


-make an easy way to push event winners in the backend (component for admin)


b. API Endpoints
Challenge Creation: Endpoint to initiate a challenge between users, specifying the initiator, the challenged user, and draft order preference.
Challenge Response: Endpoint for users to accept or decline challenges.
Draft Picks: Endpoints for users to select their draft picks in the order specified by the challenge.
Event and Player Sync: Endpoints (or scheduled tasks) to sync player and event data from the PDGA API.
Event Result Submission: A secure backend interface for you to manually enter event results.
c. Business Logic
Implement the logic for:

Draft pick selections ensuring no player is selected more than once.
Calculating points based on event results.
Updating user points and challenge statuses after an event concludes.
4. Frontend Development
a. Challenge System
Build out UI components to:

Display open challenges and allow users to accept/decline.
Create new challenges against other users.
b. Drafting Interface
Develop a drafting interface that:

Lists available players fetched from your backend.
Enforces the draft order and selection rules you've outlined.
Updates in real-time as each user makes their selections.
c. Event and Leaderboard Display
Create components to:

Display upcoming and past events, including their results.
Show the leaderboard based on user points.
5. Testing and Iteration
After implementing the core functionalities, rigorously test the application to ensure everything works as expected. Pay special attention to edge cases in the drafting process and challenge system.

6. Deployment and Monitoring
Once satisfied with the development, deploy your application. Monitor its performance and user feedback to make improvements over time.

7. Administrative Backend for Event Results
Given the PDGA API's limitations regarding event results, creating a simple administrative interface to input event results manually will be crucial. This could be a simple form in your Rails app secured by authentication.

Starting Steps
Start Small: Begin by setting up the backend models and their associations.
API Integration: Work on integrating the PDGA API to fetch and store player and event data.
Core Features First: Focus on building out the challenge and draft functionalities before moving on to more complex features like the live draft system.
By breaking down the project into manageable pieces and focusing on one feature at a time, you can systematically work through the development process. Remember, it's essential to test each part thoroughly before moving on to the next to ensure a solid foundation for your application.
